The features I mainly contributed to was the profile page where users are able to select a profile picture. The profile_display page also offers a preview of the profile picture and the ability to update your name. It also functions as a dashboard where users can add their height, weight, and other variables to track their health.</p>\n",

    "\n",
    "<p>I have compiled a brief list of all the new concepts that I have learned a lot about during this trimester.</p>\n",
    "<ul>\n",
    "  <li><strong>@token_required/decorator functions:</strong> When doing the first spot check, I would be able to authenticate on Postman without the JWT token. I later learned that this means that the corresponding part of the code where the user is able to authenticate themself does not have a @token_required function. This function is required to protect routes and prevent unauthorized authentication.</li>\n",
    "  <li><strong>JWT authentication (concept):</strong> JWT is an abbreviation for JSON web token which is a method of transmitting encrypted information between two parties. The three parts of a JWT token are the header, payload, and signature. The payload is the aspect of the token that is responsible for storing the \"data\" of the transmission and contains the encrypted information. The payload can be decrypted using tools such as jwt.io that requires a token prior to decrypting.</li>\n",
