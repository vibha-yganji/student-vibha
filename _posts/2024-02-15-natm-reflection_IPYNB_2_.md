## **Feedback from Demos**

#### **Glows**
- In our later demos, our audience really liked the food tracker and its ability to create a pie chart and measure how close an individual's diet was to the USDA recoomended daily amounts.
- We were also given the suggestion to add additional profile picture functionality through the ability to upload profile pictures. 


#### **Grows**
- Our demos started out being very disorganized as our team was unsure of how to split the presentation of the features and the code for both the frontend + backend among each team member.
- As a result, we were unable to properly present all features in the initial demos and did not receive enough feedback.
- Some of our audience members also commented on the organization of your navigation on the home page and suggested to declutter it (this can be implemented by ).


## **Other Team Reviews**

I do not have any pictures as my phone was dead :(

#### **Eshika, Aditi, Nupur, Avanthika's project:** 

- This team's project incorporated a feature that allowed the user to input a beverage and the corresponding sugar level would be provided as an output.
- This feature really interested me as it was very similar to the food tracker on our project buts adds a more user-based functionality and provides important information to the user. 


#### **Ananya, Priya, Arushi, Sumedha's project:**
- This team's project related to mental health and provided a quiz that allowed the individual to assess their mental status.
- This project also interested me as it was a unique idea that I did not see implemented in anyone else's project at NATM. 

## **Additions to CPT Project**

- Based off of the feedback that we had recieved from different audiences, some potential additions to our project are to create a profile system that allows for user to upload images and a leaderboard that uses a coin system for the various health trackers.

## **Projects Outside of CompSci**

#### **Anusha's Photography**
- I really enjoyed looking at Anusha's photography pictures as the view of San Diego during the holiday season was very beautiful to see.
