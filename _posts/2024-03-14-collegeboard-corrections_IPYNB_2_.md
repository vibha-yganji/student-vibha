**Overall Score** - 18/70

## 2
- A is the correct answer as opposed to my answer of C as the height has to fall between 50 and 80 inches. My answer choice of C uses an OR statement for the height which would mean that the individual has to ehtiehr be less than 50 inches or greater than 80 inches whoch is nonsensical and not applicable to the given situation.

## 7
- C (a counter value of 4) is the correct answer as due to the game piece being one space to the left of a yellow space, the counter will increase to 1. The piece will then be shifted 3 spaces to the left where it will arrive again at another yellow spot. The counter increases to 2 and when the piece is moved again, it arrives 3 spaces to the left of a green space. The counter goes to 3 and the piece moves two to the right of a red spot which causes the counter to move up to 4. The final counter value is 4. 

## 10
- The correct decimal form of 11000 is 24. This can be found by doing 2^4 + 2^3 = 24.

## 12
- C is the correct answer for this question as during each loop cycle, this code makes the robot turn left if there's an open space to its left. Then, regardless of whether it turns left or not, the code tries to make the robot move forward by one square. Initially, the robot moves forward three squares for the first three loops. Then, it turns left in the next loop. After that, it moves forward three squares for the following three loops. It repeats this pattern until it reaches the gray square at the bottom left corner of the grid, moving forward three squares in the last three loops.

## 14
- Lines 8 and 12 should be switched as true should only be returned when there is an increasing order of the elements in the list and false should be returned is there is a decreasing order of elements in the list. This is switched around in the code.

- A is the correct code segment that can be used to draw the pict

## 54
- B is the correct  answer as the information provided only describes the times that the trucks enter + leave and other information about the truck itself. There if no mention of the number of deliveries for each truck.

## 55
- C is the correct answer as the variable len is the length of utensils while temp is assigned the value of the last element of utensils. REMOVe is then used to take out 'whisk' from utensils and then uses INSERT to add 'whisk' as the first element of the list. 

## 56
- Answer option A is the correct answer as using SpreadsheetS I and II is optimal as using the student IDs in S2 to find the students who play a sport to find the GPAs of students who play sports (by using Spreadhsheet 1) will allow for comparison to the other GPAs of other students that can be found in S1.

## 57
- A is the correct answer as it is optimal if the running times on both processors are nearly equal.
- Putting P and Q together on a singular processor would be 40 seconds while R and S together would be approximately 25 seconds. Compared to the other possible configurations, this is optimal as it creates the most equal times between the two processors.


## 58
- The geographic position of the user is important to know as the other answers such as the time and routes near the user's home (which they may not be currently present at) are not necessary for finding running routes. 

## 59
- Answer option C is the only data that was not given by Adrianna herself. The locations of other app users would be collected from other users' devices.

## 60 
- Answer option C is correct as it is an excellent benefit of the app to encourage users to workout together.
- The other answer options such as D are incorrect as the app uses GPS information to find users and also has to have Internet access.


## 61
- Answer option C is a privacy concern as having the ability to determine the location of a stranger when they begin a run on the app can be dangerous.

## 62
- C is the correct answer as individuals who do not sign up for a premium account do not get any advertisements.

## 63
- A and D are the correct expressions.
- A is correct as (NOT input1) evaluates

## 64
- Removal of Lines 8 and 10 will cause the procedure to work as intended. Line 8 needs to be removed as the retun statement causes the code block to finish running earlier on without checking the age condition. Line 10 also needs to be removed as it is being assigned the incorrect variable for its value. Instead of adult, it should be assigned the value of the variable senior citizen.

## 65
- B and C are the correct answers. In B, NOT humid would evaluate to True and the conditional would proceed to evaluate to true as a result of the OR statement between a Boolean that is True (hot) and a Boolean that is False (humid).
- C is also correct as the if conditional evaluates to True and the code proceeds to display hot which is equivalent to True. 

## 66 
- A and D can be used.
- A is the correct answer as it satisifes the condition of timer being given a value of 1000 if timer is greater than or equal to 30. If timer falls between 30 and 60, only the first if conditional will be evaluated and bonus will be given a value of 1000. However, if timer falls above 60, bonus will be given a value of 1500.
- By a similar logic, D is also a correct answer as it creates 3 separate conditionals that deal with the value of timer. The first conditional checks if timer is greater than 60, the second if timer falls between 30 and 60, and the 3rd if timer is less than 30. 

## 67
- Code segment A can be used to simulate the behavior of the spinner as the first condition will be True only 25% of the time. For the remaining 75%, Code Segment A will execute the second block of code in the else statmen. 50% of the time in the else code block, the display of the orange will happen while in the other 50%, the display of purple will happen. 
- Code Segment D can also be used to simulate the spinner's behavior through a similar logic as it begins with a 1-4 randomizer. 1/4 of the time, blue will be displayed through the use of an if conditional. The else statement is the same as Code Segmeent A.

## 68
- The code segment only accounts for duplicates if they are adjacent to each other. Answer option A contains duplicates of the number 10 at both the beginning and end of the list. Similarly, answer option C contains duplicates of 40 at both the middle and end of the list. 

## 69
- A and D are the correct answers.
- A will require metadata as the images cannot tell you the exact time that the pictures were taken whereas C will also require metadata as you typically cannot identify an exact date from looking at an image unless you have a clear memory of each day. 

## 70
- A is the correct answer as when substring is performed using the paramters oldStr, 1, and (n-1), left will be equivalent to all characters in OldStr to the left of index whereas right will be equivalent to all characters to the right of index n in OldStr. When both the left and right vairables are concatenated, all the characters excpet for the character in position n will be included in newStr. 
- C is also correct by a similar logic as newStr will be equivalent to all characters to the left of the character in index n of oldStr. When newStr is concatenated with all the characters to the right of the charcater in position n of OldStr, the new variable will be equivalent to all the characters in OldStr except for the character in position n.
