**Overview of Plan:**

- full idea for plan is on the following issues:
    - [Vibha](https://github.com/vibha-yganji/student-vibha/issues/13#issue-2299295199) 
    - [Prakruti]()

**Task feature**
- Prakruti and I will work on creating an extension of a task creation/tracker feature where users can input a set of variables relating to a certain task (the name, its deadline, and their progress on the assignment) and assign the task a certain priority as well. 
- 

### **Timeline**

| 05/15 - 05/20 | **Extension of Task Feature**         | Prakruti and I will work on extending the task feature by allowing for users to assign priorities to each task. We will also develop the ability for users to filter out and sort each task depending on its priority (or search for a certain priority value).           |
